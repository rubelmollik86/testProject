                    keeps the more or an extra amount of money in their account
                    then they will not be able to withdraw the extra amount
                    which is kept in the Fly Far Agent portal. Whenever

                  <p>
                    All the rates presented on our website are inclusive of all
                    taxes and service charges except any city taxes, resort fee
                    or other charges directly payable at the hotel by the

                  <p>
                    Rates displayed on the Fly Far International website are

                    your booking is complete and you are charged, there is no
                    refund for the price difference, because rates can
                    change/fluctuate at any time without any notification as
                    these rates run totally on a real time basis globally .

                  <p>
                    You can book tickets to all over the world using our
                    website. Please note that seats, meals, frequent flyer and
                    other special requests are requests only. The airline
                    reserves the right to apply any revisions to the requested
                    seat allocation without notification. All requests should be
                    verified with the airline. We do not guarantee you will be
                    assigned the seat you have requested. We also do not
                    guarantee that meals, frequent flyer and other special
                    requests will be confirmed by the airline. It is therefore
                    recommended to contact the airline directly to confirm these
                    requests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your customers have excess baggage, will have to pay any
                    excess baggage fee assessed by each airline. When there are
                    two or more airlines involved for connecting flights, they
                    may have to reclaim bags at the connecting airport and
                    check-in again to continue the journey. In these cases, if
                    excess baggage, will have to pay any excess baggage fee
                    assessed by each airline. We recommend traveling light to
                    reduce these costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All Airlines have differing rules and policies regarding
                    schedule changes, which are beyond our control. Due to the
                    operational needs of each airline, changes are often made to
                    the flights that they are currently operating. Often these
                    changes are a prediction of travel needs for a future date
                    but can also reflect same day changes. Fly Far International
                    does not assume any liability whatsoever for canceled
                    flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting
                    due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines. We will
                    inform you about the changes after being notified from
                    Airlines or Suppliers that itâ€™s your responsibility to
                    inform your customer about changes.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Holiday</h4>
                  <p>
                    Package rates are valid as per our mentioned validity dates
                    and for the room category specified. Should the period of
                    stay or room type change, above rates will not be valid.
                    Hotel rates are not valid during trade fairs, exhibitions,
                    blackout periods, and special events. A surcharge will be
                    levied in those cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Photos of the hotel and information provided regarding the
                    service, amenities, products, etc. have been provided to us
                    by the supplier. Fly Far International accepts NO
                    RESPONSIBILITY for any changes that the supplier has not
                    updated. Specific features such as bedding type or
                    non-smoking rooms are simply a request and not guaranteed
                    unless otherwise specified by the hotel. While most hotels
                    will strive to honor your requests, neither Fly Far
                    International nor the hotel will guarantee that your request
                    will be honored.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No amendment (name changes, date changes, hotel change, etc)
                    will be done once the booking is confirmed.
                  </p>

                    Fly Far International process visa for all popular
                    destinations worldwide. For places where the submission has
                    to be by the individuals, we only process the papers for the
                    client. Clients shall have to face embassy interviews by
                    themselves if needed. We also do not provide any assurance
                    of getting a visa, as that depends solely on the embassy. In
                    order to have a higher chance of getting visa, clients are
                    suggested to-
