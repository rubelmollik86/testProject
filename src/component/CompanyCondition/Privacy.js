                    With this permission, the User allows Fly Far International
                    for letting the User know the benefits of ongoing specific
                    offers on the User’s location. When the User launches Fly
                    Far International app for travel booking, Fly Far
                    International detects the User’s location automatically and
                    the User’s nearest airport or city is auto-filled. For
                    international journeys, this action allows Fly Far
                    International in calculating the User’s time zone and to
                    provide information consequently.

                    <span>E) Photo/ Media/ Files: </span>
                    The libraries in the app use these permissions to allow map
                    data to be saved to the user's phone's external storage,
                    like SD cards. By saving map data locally, the user's
                    smartphone doesn't need to re-download the same map data
                    every time the user uses the app. This provides users a
                    seamless Map based Hotel selection experience, even on low
                    bandwidth networks.

                    flights/ package options to choose from, etc.

                    <span>G) SMS:- </span>If the User allows Fly Far
                    International to access its SMS, Fly Far International reads
                    SMS and fills the One Time Password (“OTP”) automatically
                    while making transactions. This offers the User a
                    hassle-free booking experience and the User does not have to
                    move out of the app for checking the OTP and then filling it
                    manually.
